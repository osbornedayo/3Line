  
## To run this , run the "Application.java class"(i.e the main method) ,
array1 and array2 are the sample arrays to be encoded/decoded 





## Regarding the classification of the algorithm in terms of Big O notation ,
 the encodeArray function has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over each element of the arrays A and B. 
 The decodeArray function also has a time complexity of O(n)  because it performs the reverse process for each element. 
 Therefore, both the encoding and decoding processes have a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the size of the arrays.
